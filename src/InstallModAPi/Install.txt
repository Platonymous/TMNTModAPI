or 

Extract the files and then extract modapidata.zip into the same folder as TMNT.exe and rename ParisSerializers.dll to ParisSerializers.org.dll and ParisSerializers.mod to ParisSerializers.dll
(use 7zip or some other programm or windows might block the modapis files aswell)

-Uninstall-

Delete ParisSerializers.dll and rename ParisSerializers.org.dll to ParisSerializers.dll
or go to Steam -> TMNT -> Properties and choose "Verify intefrity of game files..."
If you want you can also delete 0ModApi.dll, 0Harmony.dll and the Mods folder, but after renaming the ParisSerializer file they will be ignored.

-Update-
Follow the same steps as the initial installation, the old files will be replaced.
